# Prototype Pattern

## Overview
The Prototype Pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is used when the creation of an object is costly or complex.

## Use Case
Creating copies of documents.

## Classes

### Abstract Class
- **Document**: Abstract class with cloning capability.

### Concrete Classes
- **WordDocument**: Concrete document class.

## How to Run the Demo
The `PrototypePatternDemo.java` class demonstrates how to create copies of documents using the prototype pattern.

To run the demo:
1. Navigate to the directory `DesignPatterns\Creational\Prototype`.
2. Compile the Java files: `javac *.java`.
3. Run the demo: `java PrototypePatternDemo`.
